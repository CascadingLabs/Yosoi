`yosoi.contracts.RuntimeContract`

```python
RuntimeContract = _runtime_contracts.RuntimeContract
```

Author a Contract schema for extraction and validation in Rust.

The schema defines grouping, fields, cardinalities, and value types. Unsupported
conversions remain explicit validation issues rather than inferred Python
conversions.

Attributes:
    contract_schema: Public schema validated when the native Contract is
        constructed.
