```

An admitted hostname with explicit reachability evidence.

Attributes:
    host: Canonical admitted hostname without a scheme or path.
    observations: Retained source evidence, bounded by policy.
    verification: unverified for discovery alone; http_observed for an observed HTTP
        response. Neither proves ownership, application success, or future
        availability.
