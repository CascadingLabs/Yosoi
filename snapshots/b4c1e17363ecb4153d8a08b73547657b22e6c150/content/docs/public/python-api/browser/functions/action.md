`yosoi.browser.action`

```python
async def action(url: str, flow: Flow, *, policy: Policy | None=None, cancellation: CancellationToken | None=None) -> FlowOutcome:
```

Navigate to ``url``, then run the flow with managed SDK cleanup.

Caller cancellation stops subsequent steps and preserves partial/unknown
execution facts. Cancellation is not rollback; managed cleanup still runs.
